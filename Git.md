## <a name="creatingBranches">Create Branch</a>

1. First, check in which branch you are right now:   
```
git branch
```
You'll get a list of the branchs available, the branch with an ```*``` next to it, is the branch you are working on.

2. Then, create a new branch:
```
git branch name_of_the_branch_to_create
```

3. Move to the new branch created:
```
git checkout name_of_the_branch_to_create
```

4. You can do step 2 and 3 by one command:
```
git checkout -b name_of_the_branch_to_create
```

[Modifying Commits](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/lessons/f02167ad-3ba7-40e0-a157-e5320a5b0dc8/concepts/e176503b-3eae-4b22-a1b3-2953bab3d5e5)

### Changing the last commit message
`$ git commit --amend`

### Add files to last commit
* edit the file(s)
* save the file(s)
* stage the file(s)
* and run `git commit --amend`

### Reverse a previously made commit, undo the changes
`$ git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-revert>`

### [Reset vs Revert](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/lessons/f02167ad-3ba7-40e0-a157-e5320a5b0dc8/concepts/fed81eb7-49b4-4129-9f6b-8201e0796fd8)
At first glance, resetting might seem coincidentally close to reverting, but they are actually quite different. Reverting creates a new commit that reverts or undos a previous commit. Resetting, on the other hand, erases commits!

Before I do any resetting, I usually create a backup branch on the most-recent commit so that I can get back to the commits if I make a mistake.

### Change the git upstream url from SSH to HTTPS or back
`$ git remote set-url origin git@github.fkinternal.com:Flipkart/siso-analysis.git`
